## K2 Halo Photometry

This is code that implements a Total Variation (TV) based regularization for Kepler/K2 photometry of very bright stars. 

We minimize nth order TV - i.e. the sum of the absolute values of the nth differences of a light curve - of a light curve created as the weighted sum of pixels, with weights in (0,1). This appears remarkably effective at removing pointing-based systematics from K2 lightcurves where it is impractical to do photometry otherwise and apply more standard detrending methods. 

We believe this is of practical use for Kepler targets brighter than  Kp ~ 6. 

## Basic usage

Call halophot either as a library of functions (/src/halo_tools.py) or from the command line as, e.g.

halo ktwo200007768-c04_lpd-targ.fits --data-dir /path/to/data/directory/ --name Atlas -c 4 --do-plot

where --name is the star name you would like to save the outputs under, and -c is the campaign.
